# LeadGen-OS Docs

This folder is the single source of truth for product direction, architecture, data, and operations.

## Start here
- [Vision](./VISION.md)
- [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)
- [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Data Model](./DATA_MODEL.md)
- [API](./API.md)
- [Scoring](./SCORING.md)
- [Runbook](./RUNBOOK.md)
- [Blueprint (legacy / working notes)](./LEADGEN_OS_BLUEPRINT.md)

## Golden rules
- Code follows docs. If docs are unclear, the system will drift.
- “Deterministic by default.” Any non-determinism must be explicit.
- Prefer explainability over cleverness.

## Current phase
- Phase: Fit + Outcomes + Explainable scoring (Opportunity/Risk/Readiness)
- Goal: Make lead quality differences impossible to misunderstand
