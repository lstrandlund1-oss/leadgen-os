## What LeadGen-OS is
A deterministic lead-generation system that turns provider data into ranked, explainable leads, with clear Opportunity vs Risk, and eventually a full “pipeline to money” workflow.

## Who it is for
- Primary: Operators selling services to local businesses (SMEs) who need leads now.
- Later: Teams/agencies needing repeatable prospecting + outreach + tracking.

## Core promise
“Give me the next 25 businesses I should contact, and tell me exactly why.”

## What we optimize for
- Stability > speed
- Determinism > heuristics
- Explainability > black box AI
- Tight scope > scattered features

## Product pillars
1) Lead discovery (providers)
2) Normalization + classification
3) Scoring (Opportunity/Risk/Readiness)
4) Fit scoring (needs mapping)
5) Outreach generation (angle + script)
6) Outcome tracking (contacted → replied → booked → closed)
7) Feedback loops (use outcomes to improve ranking)

## Non-goals (for now)
- Full CRM replacement
- Inbox/email sending
- Complex multi-user permissions

# Vision

LeadGenOS is a deterministic lead intelligence system built for marketing agencies.

It identifies businesses with growth potential by analyzing:
- Reputation signals
- Digital presence
- Structural gaps
- Market positioning

The system provides:
- Explainable scoring (Opportunity vs Risk)
- Clear outreach angles
- Deterministic logic (no black-box randomness)

This is NOT:
- A generic lead scraper
- A mass spam tool
- A random AI output generator

It is a structured intelligence engine.
