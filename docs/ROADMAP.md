# Roadmap

## Now (current sprint)
- Fit scoring (needs mapping + fitScore computation)
- Outcome tracking (save + fetch + UI)
- UI clarity: show Score, Opportunity, Risk, Readiness, Fit
- Kill legacy fields safely

## Next
- Real providers (Google Places / SERP) beyond mock
- Profiles (user + saved preferences + saved segments)
- Saved lead lists + export workflows
- Rate limiting + caching hardening

## Later
- Multi-user + auth (real accounts)
- Team workspaces
- “Playbooks”: outreach sequences per niche
- Learning loop: outcomes influence ranking

## Definition of done for each milestone
- Works end-to-end
- Deterministic outputs
- Explainable reasoning
- Minimal UI confusion
- No breaking changes without doc update
